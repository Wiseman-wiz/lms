## Learning Management System for Kaunlaran Elementary School Grade 1 Students


The system aims to develop a learning system that will aid the teachers in discussing the lessons, and engage the students to the lessons. Education leaders may analyse and review their professional learning systems to ensure that they support every educator in gaining the knowledge, skills, practices, and dispositions necessary to contribute to student learning.

## Description

The System is envisioned to be simple yet informative particularly to Grade 1 students. Various activities are integrated to lessons to engage the students. At the end of every lesson, a quiz will be taken by a student to assess how well he/she understand the lesson.

Each page design will be carefully designed to make it appealing to students. Likewise, it will be made to be user friendly.

Security will be insured so that only authorized users can access the system. Moreover, HTML, MySQL and PHP will be used to develop the system. Although it is a web based system, students will not be able to access the quizzes at home. Only lessons can be accessed from home.

 Teachers can view the student’s records, and the completed activities. He/She can also input grades of his/her students into the system, as well as comments of a student’s performance.

Students who will be taking a quiz must log-in. Correspondingly, teachers also log-in before he/she records vital information into the system such as grades, and alike.

The system will not only utilize text but also images and various learning videos will be incorporated to lessons to engage students.

Grade 1 students and their teachers, as well as the principal of Kaunlaran Elementary School can access the system.

Parents can view his/her children’s scores in quizzes, as well as the grade in selected subjects. They may interact with the teacher about his/her children’s performance.
